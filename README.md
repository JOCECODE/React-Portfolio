## Description

Here is my Portfolio. I am currently working on it and hope to add in more projects to it. Let me know of any suggestions I should make into it or add. I find myself struggling to style and make the page look good. Also, it is not mobile ready sorry folks.

## Updates

- [ ] I am going to work on adding more links to the projects and where they are deployed.
- [ ] Add "learn more" page. Currently it is a nice orange button that does nothing.
- [ ] Add more projects.
- [ ] Edit videos for just the application.
- [ ] Fix styling on footer.
- [ ] Contact form. Currently, I am taking a php online course and want to incorporate it into my portfolio.
- [ ] Mobile responsive
